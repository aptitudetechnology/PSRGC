Prompt:

Using the table in README.md, create a minimum viable prototype Lua script that defines an agent for each social role, where each role personifies a computer component:

- The Worker (CPU): Handles calculations and core logic.
- The Artist (GPU): Manages rendering and parallel tasks.
- The Manager (Motherboard): Coordinates communication between agents.
- The Assistant (RAM): Provides short-term memory for active tasks.
- The Archivist (Hard Drive): Handles long-term, slower storage.
- The Librarian (SSD): Manages long-term, high-speed storage.
- The Building Manager (PSU): Distributes power/resources to agents.
- The Musician (Sound Card): Processes audio input/output.
- The Communicator (Radio Modem): Facilitates wireless data exchange.
- The Sculptor (TPU): Optimized for machine learning and AI tasks, processing vast amounts of data for predictions.

Each agent should be represented as a Lua table or object with basic properties and a method that demonstrates its role. The script should show how these agents interact and work together to accomplish a simple task, such as processing a request, storing data, and communicating results. Focus on clear role separation and basic collaboration between agents.
