# PSRGC VSG System - Trade-Educated Development Prompt

## System Overview
Develop a software-first implementation of VSG (Valet, Stylist, Groomer) - a PSRGC (Personified Social Role Genome Chassis) grooming and styling system featuring three professionally-educated AI personas: The Valet (coordinator), The Stylist (creative specialist), and The Groomer (maintenance specialist).

## Core Architecture Principles

### Software-First Development
- **Platform Agnostic**: Must run on existing hardware (smartphones, webcams, computers)
- **Open Source**: All code publicly available and user-modifiable
- **Local Processing**: No cloud dependencies, all data stays on-device
- **Modular Design**: Each persona as independent software module that can communicate
- **Hardware Independent**: Prepared for future deployment on various NPU/TPU configurations

### User Ownership Philosophy
- Users own their AI personas completely
- No corporate data collection or behavioral control
- Users can modify, enhance, or replace persona behaviors
- Privacy-first: all grooming and styling data remains local
