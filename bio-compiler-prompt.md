Prompt:

Create a Lua bio-compiler script that takes the agents and logic defined in Lua scripts generated from the social-role.md prompt and converts them into FASTA files. Each agent or function should be represented as a unique sequence in the FASTA format, with headers describing the social role and its function. The script should parse the Lua code, extract relevant structures, and output a valid FASTA file for each agent, demonstrating a mapping from computational roles to biological sequence representations.
